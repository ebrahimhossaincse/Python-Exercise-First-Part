'''
Write a function that takes a number 1 to 9 from the user input (use input function inside a function).
Store a number in a variable (letâ€™s assume 6).
If the input value is less than the variable, print "Your guess is almost there".
If the input value is greater than the variable, print "Your guess is higher".
If the input value and variable are equal, print "Your Guess Is Correct!".
